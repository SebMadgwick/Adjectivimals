Adjectivimals
=============

An idea for generating unique SSIDs for [x-OSC](www.x-io.co.uk/x-osc/).  I found a list of [adjectives](http://grammar.yourdictionary.com/parts-of-speech/adjectives/list-of-adjective-words.html) and a list of [animal names](http://rickcreation.com/rickwalton/curricul/lanimals.htm) and combined them to create every unique combination of less than 13 characters.  The result is [names.txt](https://github.com/SebMadgwick/Adjectivimals/blob/master/names.txt).
